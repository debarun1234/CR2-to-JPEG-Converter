# CR2 to JPEG Converter with Image Enhancement

## Introduction

This Python script provides a versatile tool for converting Canon Raw (CR2) image files to JPEG format while simultaneously applying image enhancements to improve image quality. The code carries out a series of image processing steps, including brightness, contrast, and saturation adjustments, as well as histogram equalization, to create a visually pleasing and enhanced JPEG image. The final output is a balanced and visually appealing image with improved contrast, all while preserving the original color balance.

## Features

- **CR2 to JPEG Conversion**: The script is capable of efficiently converting CR2 files to the widely supported JPEG format, making your raw images more accessible and easy to share.

- **Image Enhancement**: The script applies a set of image adjustments to enhance the overall quality of the image, ensuring it looks its best. These adjustments include:
  - **Brightness Enhancement**: Adjust the image's brightness level for better visibility.
  - **Contrast Enhancement**: Improve the distinction between different parts of the image.
  - **Saturation Enhancement**: Adjust the color saturation for a more vibrant appearance.
  - **Histogram Equalization**: This step reduces noise and enhances the overall image quality, resulting in a well-balanced and visually appealing image.

- **Customization**: The code provides flexibility in adjusting enhancement parameters, including brightness, contrast, and saturation. This allows you to fine-tune the output image according to your preferences.

## Requirements

To use this script, you'll need the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- Python libraries: Pillow (PIL), rawpy, numpy

You can easily install the required libraries using `pip`:


```bash
pip install pillow rawpy numpy
```
